This repository contains materials from an education outreach workshop.
The goal of the workshop is to introduce basic computer science concepts related to graph theory, data structures, and programming in an interdisciplinary way through the history of the US telegraph network. 
\
\
This repository includes:
- **Materials for a short history lesson** in which students can decipher clues to build a large, physical timeline (I did this with a 10ft rope marked with 5 year intervals) of the US telegraph network. Important events incude the first telegram, the construction of the transcontinental telegraph line, and how telegrpah communication affected the Civil War. This activity provides some historical background and offers a foundation for discussion about what networks are and what it means to encode messages.
- **Two self-contained Jupyter Notebooks**
   - **telegraph_network** guides students to answer questions about the telegraph network in 1846 while learning about graph theory concepts. How many telegraph lines (edges) connect to New York (a node)? What happens to the network if you remove the node "Boston"?
   - **morse_code** introduces the concept of data structures throgh a morse code translator that references a dictionary. However, there's a catch! The translator returns an error for some messages. Students are invited to troubleshoot this problem and gain some realistic de-bugging experience. 
- A **Documentation Packet** that contains a glossary of graph theory terms and information about all of the functions included in the Notebooks. Much of this information is also included in the Notebooks themselves. The goal of this packet is to give students a first place to look when they have questions.
